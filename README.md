<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project 

This was a group project and the original project link can be found <a href="https://github.com/Jamie-GiHu/Victoria_Road_Crashes" alt="Victoria Road Crash Original Repo">here</a>
## ROAD INCIDENTS ACROSS VICTORIA

 Road statistics are well reported, but are there trends and relationships around preventative measures such as speed limit restrictions, road upgrades and road safety cameras.  We asked which one is the most effective at preventing incidents and what type of incidents.  

 We dove into the data to see if our hypothesis that road upgrades are likely to be the most effective.

 Key questions considered were:

 * Is there a correlation between the number and type of road incidents and the speed limit?  Eg - Fatalities / Serious injury / Minor or no injury as classified by VicRoads.
 * Does local government spending improve road conditions to prevent incidents?
 * Does the overall demographics (age / average income / gender) of local government areas have an impact on the number of incidents?
 * Do speed camera locations actually decrease crash numbers within a radius of 1km from the incidents v those outside 1 km of the speed camera?

## Getting Started
JUPYTER NOTEBOOKS
 
 #Warning: Please run 'JAMIE TAN Speed Camera Cleaning Codes' first before running the Merged Analysis Jupyter Notebook. 
 (There is a file that is too big as an output and we are not able to upload the output file to the repository via GitHub.)
 
 1 x Merged Analysis codes are in notebook named "Merged Analysis Code - Victoria Road Crash"
 
 2 x Individual files containing cleaning codes used by Tas and Jamie on Demographic analysis and Speed Camera analysis respectively
 
     - TAS TUDOR Vic_Crash_analysis_TT_Cleanup
     
     - JAMIE TAN Speed Camera Cleaning Codes
 
##Results
We summarised the following from our data analysis.

* There is a correlation between socio-economic factors and the number of road incidents. Targeted programs could decrease road crashes.
* Speed limit restrictions and light conditions affect road fatalities in Victoria
* Spending money to build, repair and upgrade roads do not seem to have any effect on reduction of  number of road accidents and road fatalities
* Traffic cameras seem to statistically significant effect on reducing road fatalities
